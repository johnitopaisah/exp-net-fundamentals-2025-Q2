## üìå Objective  
To design, automate, and validate the deployment of a secure Windows Server 2025 EC2 instance within a custom AWS VPC using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** via AWS CloudFormation, Bash scripting, and AWS CLI ‚Äî followed by a complete teardown of the environment.

## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Design Overview

- **VPC**: `10.200.123.0/24`
- **Public Subnet**: `10.200.123.0/25` (auto-assign public IP)
- **Private Subnet**: `10.200.123.128/25`
- **Internet Gateway**: Routed to the public subnet
- **Security Group**:
  - Allow **RDP (3389)** and **SSH (22)** from `MyIP`
  - Allow all traffic within `10.200.123.0/24`
- **EC2 Instance**:
  - Windows Server 2025 (AMI: `ami-077d884fe0477d60d`)
  - Type: `t3.large`
  - Volume: 125 GiB `gp3`
  - **Secondary ENI** in the private subnet

## üìú CloudFormation Template

Defined in `window-ec2-server.yml` and includes:

- `Parameters`:
  - `VpcCidr`, `PublicSubnetCidr`, `PrivateSubnetCidr`, `AvailabilityZone`, and `MyIP`
- `Resources`:
  - VPC, subnets, route tables, gateway, EC2 instance, security group, ENI
- `Outputs`:  
  Returns instance ID, subnet IDs, VPC ID, and KeyPair name

**Validation Command:**

Validate the template by running the command below from the terminal

```bash
aws cloudformation validate-template \
  --template-body file://window-ec2-server.yml
```

**Output:**

This will display the list of all the resource the stack will provision as shown below

## üöÄ Deployment Script: deploy-win-ser.sh

Once the template (`window-ec2-server.yml`) has been validate, you can now move ahead with the deployment of the template by running the deployment script (`deploy-win-ser.sh`) from the terminal,to start the deployment of the resource using CFN template. To do this, we run this command
```bash
  ./bin/deploy.sh
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  Please note that, you have to make this script executable by running this command `chmod +x ./bin/desploy.sh` before running the deployment command above.

**üì§ Stack Outputs**

This section shows the final output values from the deployed CloudFormation stack.
It includes the EC2 instance ID, VPC ID, subnet IDs, and KeyPair name ‚Äî serving as proof 
that all resources were provisioned successfully. The screenshot below provides visual 
confirmation of the output in the terminal.
