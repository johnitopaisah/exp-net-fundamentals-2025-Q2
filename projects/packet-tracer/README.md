# ðŸ§ª Packet Tracer DHCP Lab â€“ Basic Networking Simulation

This project demonstrates a basic DHCP-enabled network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal is to help beginners understand core networking concepts through a hands-on simulation of devices like routers, switches, PCs, and DHCP servers.

> ðŸ“˜ Full instructions and step-by-step explanations are available in [`Journal.md`](./Journal.md)

## ðŸ”§ Lab Overview

- **Router** (Cisco ISR 4331) â€“ Configured with a static IP as gateway  
- **Switch** â€“ Connects all devices within the LAN  
- **Server** â€“ Acts as a DHCP server  
- **PC** â€“ DHCP client receiving dynamic IP configuration  

Using Packet Tracerâ€™s simulation mode, the lab also visualizes the DHCP process (DORA), ARP behavior, and how packets traverse OSI layers.

## âœ… Learning Objectives

- Build and connect a small LAN topology  
- Configure static and dynamic IP addressing  
- Enable and test DHCP services  
- Analyze packet flow and encapsulation in simulation mode  
- Understand ARP, STP, and broadcast behavior

---

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. Download and open [`packet-tracer-lab.pkt`](packet-tracer-lab.pkt) in **Cisco Packet Tracer (v8.2 or newer)**
2. Review configuration commands and steps in [`Journal.md`](Journal.md)
3. Optionally toggle to **Simulation Mode** to trace packet behavior
4. Use `ipconfig /release` and `ipconfig /renew` from the PC to trigger DHCP
